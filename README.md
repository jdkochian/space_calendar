# space_calendar
Calendar GUI that allows a user to quickly see Nasa's astronomy picture of the day for a selected date. Requires an internet connection and a Nasa API Key. Works with Nasa's database of JSON data using a developer key. 

Plan to implement this logic into a flask webapp as well as add Mars Rover pictures.
